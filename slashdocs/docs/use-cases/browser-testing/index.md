# Browser testing

We leverage Selenium for testing web browsers, so that we're compatible with just about any browser out there! 

Browser Test from Hsac fixtures offers an extensive framework for all common browser interactions. See HsacExamples.SlimTests.BrowserTests
in your local FitNesse instance for usage examples, or have a look at the [Browser Test](/fixtures/hsac-fixtures/browser-test/) page on this site
for an extensive reference!

## Features

- Local browser testing (headless, too!)
- Remote browsers (Selenium grid)
- testing using cloud providers (SauceLabs/Browserstack/etc)
