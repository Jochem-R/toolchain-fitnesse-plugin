# API Testing

API-testing is an important part of a well-balanced testing pyramid.

Using http test (and json/xml extensions of it) from hsac-fixtures, it's quite easy to test some API's. These fixtures are also able to 
leverage FreeMarker templates for easier test message generation.

To make life even easier, the toolchain-fixtures provide generic templates to convert a Hash Table from FitNesse to a JSON or XML
message. This way, we can manage our messages using generic scenario's from the FitNesse Wiki.
